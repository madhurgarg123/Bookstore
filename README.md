# Bookstore
- i used mongoose to design the schema of models 
- i used nodemailer for email notification and when everytime we add some new stoke of books in db so all users will got mail on their registered mail id 
- when i want to find sellcount so i will  simply run a mongoose query so that i will get all sellcount
